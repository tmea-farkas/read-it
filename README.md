# Welcome to Read.it - the happy place for bookworms

## Introduction

Read.it (similar pronunciation to 'reddit') is a website built in Django, using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript and Python.
The projects' target audience are people who love to immerse themselves in the World of books.
This reddit-style blog is essentially a personalised, virtual library where the user can upload, summarize, review and discuss book they've read. Users can make posts, delete or edit them, write and delete comments under posts and up/downvote a post.

In the following chapters, I will detail all aspects of production.
